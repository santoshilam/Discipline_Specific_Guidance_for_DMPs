# Case study 3: Design of working/living environment 

Author: Yan Wang 

## Project background

Due to the 2019/2022 pandemic, more and more individual started working from home. This project aims to identify key elements in a combined working/living environment and suggest customized designs for different user groups - based on type of activities and living/working conditions.



This project involves gathering information on the new work/life physical setup of the general population since the start of the COVID pandemics. It will follow with a reflection on how this new organization benefit people or hinders life and/or work. Finally, it will suggest different spatial organization based on the different types of life/work setups that have been observed.

This project will adopt a combined participatory approach in data collection and design of working/living environment. To achieve this, frequent interactions between researchers and participants are necessary.

A key aspect of this research is the use of VR environment to design work/life spaces, and allow people to "try them out". 

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

The discovery of current work/life setups will be done by surveying social media, and collect images/description of "new workspaces", as well as existing academic literature. This leads to the design of test environments that participants are asked to evaluate.

Focus group approach will be used to collect feedback/reflections on the different interior arrangement. The suggested designs of the work/life spaces will be done in 3D, with a supported platform allowing for VR tools to be used. 

The data collected during this experiment is summarized below:
- Social media images, from various sources, with various copyrights
- Online focus group session
-   voice recording
-   transcriptions of interactions for analysis.
- VR models and testing results
-  test results will be collected through interviews with the participants after the VR experiment is completed.

### Ethics 

While information is being collected from human participants, the need for personal information is limited. The use of personal infomration is mostly administrative: to setup focus group meetings, and keep track of participations in the V.R. part of the experiment. Personal data collection is limited to project management tasks, such as recruitment and meeting participants. 

However, the VR experiments are known to create discomfort for some people (nausea, verigo, diziness), and participants must be warned. Additionally, participating in a VR experiment may require participants to come on site, which, in pandemic times, requires specific attention. 


For some institutions, the use of 3rd party material from social network can be subject to an ethical review - on the basis that we are indirectly interacting with people through their online contributions. Additionally, researchers must ensure that they abide by the licenses under which this content was made available for public use. 

### Privacy 

Personal data is not the core focus on this experiment, but some will be collected anyway. Basic privacy requirements must be met to guarantee that the little personal data collected during the project is stored in a secure storage location. 

### Data sharing

The project is handled by a single research group, limiting the needs for data sharing during the project. In this instance, data sharing will occur mostly at archival time, when the results are made publicly avialable through a research data repository and publications. 

Researchers must ensure that they have the required agreement to share: 
- Public report with visuals (which may include VR setup with pictures of participants, or focus group pictures)
- Public display of designs (copyrighted)
- Public display of copyrighted material from social media

## Solutions & advice

### Data storage

For this project, any instutitonally approved storage for personal data is sufficient. No specific security measures are required in this intance. 

However, it is recommended that research separate, within this storage solution, the personal data collected to organize the experiment and the personal data that they wish to use in publication (as to ensure appropriate consent and copyrights). 

### Legal 

Legal advice will be sought out to guarantee that data collected from social media can be used for research publication. Unless the research team is very familiar with such processes, advice from the institution privacy/legal team may be required. 

The designs that are gathered from social media, as well as those produced during the experiment will be subject to copyrights. To ensure proper reuse of existsing content as well as legal protection for the created content, advice from the copyright team may be required here.  

## Advice (process)

- Separate clearly in the DMP and the storage solution the personal data needed for administrative purposes and research outputs.
- Check existing consent forms regarding V.R. experiments, as the discomfort with such tools are quite specific.
- "Designs" are "unusual" research data, with specific copyright. Input from other support teams will be of great help.
- Keep track of sources of information used when browsing social media, the original source of images and content may be needed to check what licenses those were released under.
