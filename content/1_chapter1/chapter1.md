# Guidance for DMPs in Natural Sciences

## General information to the discipline guidance

This guidance is intended to assist researchers in the natural sciences with creating effective and compliant data management plans (DMPs). The information provided is based on a survey of best practices and common requirements in the field.

## Data Description and Collection or Re-use of Existing Data

How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used?
-
-
-
What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes), will be collected or produced?
-
-
-

## Documentation and Data Quality

What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organising data) will accompany the data?
- Use of ELN in chemistry
- 
- 
What data quality control measures will be used?
-
-
-

## Storage and Backup during the Research Process
How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research?
-
-
-
How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research?
-
-
-

## Legal and Ethical Requirements, Codes of Conduct

If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured?
-
-
-
How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?
-
-
-
What ethical issues and codes of conduct are there, and how will they be taken into account?
-
-
-

## Data Sharing and Long-term Preservation
How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo reasons?
-
-
-
How will data for preservation be selected, and where data will be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)?
-
-
-
What methods or software tools are needed to access and use data?
-
-
-
How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?
-
-
-

## Data Management Responsibilities and Resources
Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)?
-
-
-
What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?
-
-
