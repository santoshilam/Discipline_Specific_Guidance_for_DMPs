# Guidance for DMPs in Chemistry

## GENERAL INFORMATION

This guidance is intended to assist researchers in Chemistry with creating effective and compliant data management plans (DMPs). The information provided is based on the collective input from participants with expertise in chemistry during the guidance wrtiting sessions.

## DATA DESCRIPTION AND COLLECTION OR RE-USE OF EXISTING DATA

_How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used?_

- chemistry/catalysis: lab experiments on given equipment under a set of parameters

_What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes), will be collected or produced?_

- observation data - In chemistry, observational data are mainly generated during experiments. Typical observations during reactions are e.g. color changes, gas formation, temperature fluctuations, ...
- catalysis:  a material with characterization (synthesis); or a performance test result obtained under a set of conditions (static or changing over time in a predetermined pattern)

## DOCUMENTATION AND DATA QUALITY

_What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organising data) will accompany the data?_

- Use of ELN in chemistry - chemotion, eLabFTW documentation in ELN
- Documentation has played a crucial role in chemistry for centuries. Observations, important steps in experiments, etc. are noted in a laboratory notebook - paper or electronic (ELN). 
- The paper lab book is mostly sorted chronologically according to the sequence of experiments. ELNs on the other hand offer the possibility to search for experiments. For example you have the option to search for a Grignard reaction. In this case, it is  possible to compare the yields and optimize the reaction conditions.
- Lab books often contain important information which are not mentioned in a (data) publication, because it is part of everyday business. To ensure subsequent use of the data, it is desirable to link the information from the DMP and the lab book.  
- Chemistry: Naming Conventions

### What data quality control measures will be used?
- 

## STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE RESEARCH PROCESS

_How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research?_

- 

_How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research?_

- Data security is coming up in chemistry with industry collaboration. Normally there is no personal data in chemistry. If chemists are working with any kind of personal data, it is coming anonymized.  

## LEGAL AND ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS, CODES OF CONDUCT

_If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured?_
- 
_How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?_
- 
_What ethical issues and codes of conduct are there, and how will they be taken into account?_
- 

## DATA SHARING AND LONG-TERM PRESERVATION

_How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo
reasons?_

- Data will be published sometimes as raw or processed data. 
- Often data is published as supporting information, but this is not a data publication. In chemistry it is a long tradition to publish data as SI, so it is hard to get chemists to rethink.
- Restrictions and embargo periods could come up with data which are generated in an industry collaboration. 

_How will data for preservation be selected, and where data will be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)?_

- Old and famous databases and repositories are the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and Crystallography Open Database (COD)
- Newer ones are: chemotion or RADAR4Chem

_What methods or software tools are needed to access and use data?_

- In chemistry there are different methods and software being used. A lot of software is still proprietary. NFDI4Chem is providing a knowledge base with examples of different formats that the data can be accessed without any problems in the future. 
- The consortium is also giving the hint: Save it in the original format and in an open format. It is still working on converters from proprietary to open formats where no open format exist.

_How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?_

- DOIs are given to the data set when it is uploaded to chemotion repository or RADAR4Chem.
- CCD has its own identifier.
- SMILES and InCHIs are structural codes as identifiers
- Other identifiers used in chemistry is the CAS number (Chemical Abstracts Service) for regular chemical compounds

## DATA MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND RESOURCES

_Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)?_

- 

_What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?_
-
