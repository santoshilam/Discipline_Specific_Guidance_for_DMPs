# Guidance for DMPs Biomedical Sciences

## General information to the discipline guidance

This guidance template is intended to assist researchers in the different fields with creating a guidace document that can help with creating an effective and compliant data management plans (DMPs). The template is based on the Science Europe DMP template.

There are different section in the template with multiple questions in each section. Neither all the sections nor all the quesions in a given section might be relevant for all the disciplines.

## Data Description and Collection or Re-use of Existing Data

_How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used?_

-
-
_What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes), will be collected or produced?_

-
-

## Documentation and Data Quality

_What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organising data) will accompany the data?_

-Medical subject headings (MeSH)
-NCBI Bioportal (directory of ontologies) [Welcome to the NCBO BioPortal | NCBO BioPortal (bioontology.org)](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)

_What data quality control measures will be used?_
-
-
-

## Storage and Backup during the Research Process

_How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research?_
-
-
-
_How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research?_
-
-
-

## Legal and Ethical Requirements, Codes of Conduct

_If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured?_

-HIPAA safe harbor method: [Methods for De-identification of PHI | HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#safeharborguidance)
-contract with on-campus or off-campus deidentification consultants (make sure to include funding for this in the budget!)

_How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?_

-In the case of a discovery that may be patentable, consult with the legal office about protecting your IP interests before publishing/disclosing data (preferably, long before).

_What ethical issues and codes of conduct are there, and how will they be taken into account?_

-Indigenous data


## Data Sharing and Long-term Preservation

_How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo reasons?_

-NIH DMS Policy rule is to share data at publication or before the end of the grant period.
-Restrictions on sharing data if data cannot be deidentified or poses a risk to the population. For example, qualitative interviews with sexual assault survivors, a population with a very rare disease.

_How will data for preservation be selected, and where data will be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)?_

-for very large datasets (ie, data that relies on images) curate the data that is shared for practical reasons (eg, difficulty of uploading 40TB of data). As a baseline, consider uploading the raw data needed for an independent researcher, in your field, to replicate your analyses from your raw data.

_What methods or software tools are needed to access and use data?_
-
-
-
_How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?_
-
-
-

## Data Management Responsibilities and Resources

_Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)?_

-usually defaults to the PI. Other involved staff may include a lab data manager

_What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?_
