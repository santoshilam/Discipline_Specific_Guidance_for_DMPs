The interviewees are employees of a company, it's business partners and  customers/prospective customers. This project aims to gather information from interviewees. The data will be used internally by the company and includes information about activities conducted by the Master's student. The data will also be used as part of the Masters student's thesis which will be published publicly. 

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

- A collection of interviews conducted as part of the company's activities
- Notes and summary documents (transcripts) - _Will there also be recordings? _

### Ethics

- Informed consent from interviewees will be required.

### Privacy 

This is a professional interview so privacy risks are minimal. Personal data are not recorded beyond what is needed to conduct the interviews. 
_Do we need to include what will happen to any personal data that is collected? Or does the company take care of this? 

### Data sharing

- Only within the research group for summary
- Personal data remains in the company
