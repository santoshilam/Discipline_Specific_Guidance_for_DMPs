# Guidance for DMPs -  in Natural Sciences, Simulation-based Climate Sciences

## General information to the discipline guidance

This guidance document is for researchers in the Simulation-based Climate Sciences field. Its goal is to help with creating an effective and compliant data management plans (DMPs). The template is based on the Science Europe DMP template.

There are different section in the template with multiple questions in each section. Neither all the sections nor all the quesions in a given section might be relevant for all the disciplines.

## Data Description and Collection or Re-use of Existing Data

_How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used?_

- new data is (1) output from statistical or physical numerical model; (2) result from an analysis from model out, model evaluation, model intercomparison, 
- re-used data can be output from statistical or numerical models, but also observations and experiments. 

_What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes), will be collected or produced?_

- kind of data: climate model output, climate model forcing data
- format: NetCDF, GRIB
- volumes: 10TB - 4PB+ 

## Documentation and Data Quality

_What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organising data) will accompany the data?_

- CF metadata conventions (climate and forecast) https://cfconventions.org/

_What data quality control measures will be used?_

-Simple quality check on the content (for example, compliance with the ranges of physical values); detailed check on compliance with CF standards; detailed check of the metadata of the repository. In individual cases: FAIR check after publishin

## Storage and Backup during the Research Process

_How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research?_
-
-
-
_How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research?_
-
-
-

## Legal and Ethical Requirements, Codes of Conduct

_If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured?_
-
-
-
_How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?_

-With regard to model code, it is essential to pay attention to who the owner is and what the usage agreements are. This also regulates the extent to which code may be published. In case of extensions of the code by own research, it has to be clarified with the model owners how the own code can be published, especially if this suggests code that cannot be published. 

_What ethical issues and codes of conduct are there, and how will they be taken into account?_
-

## Data Sharing and Long-term Preservation

_How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo reasons?_

-Raw data has to be published in case it is used as input/forcing for other models and model simulations (or other reasons) 
-Derived data are stored with a minimum retention of 10 years in appropriate storage facilities, or in a long-term archive, such as WDCC (World Data Center for Climate; www.wdc-climate.de) beyond 10 years.
-Model developments are stored and should be published. All relevant dependencies and infrastructure used need to be named. However, in compliance with the restrictions imposed by the licence to use the original model. 
-Visualisation of the modeloutput can be published e.g. as additional material to the original model output. 

_How will data for preservation be selected, and where data will be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)?_
-
-
-
_What methods or software tools are needed to access and use data?_
-
-
-
_How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?_
-
-
-

## Data Management Responsibilities and Resources

_Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)?_
-
-
-
_What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?_
