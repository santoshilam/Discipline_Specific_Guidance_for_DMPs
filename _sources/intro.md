# Introduction

Welcome to the Discipline Specific Guidance for data management plans(DMPs) compendium. This was created as part of the output of the RDA working group of the same name. While guidances for some disciplines were created during the periond of the working group the goal here is to create a collection through the contributions of reseracers and research support staff belonging to different disciplines. 

## What is this book about? 

In this book you will find the template used for gathering the guidelines for different disciplines along with the already curated guidelines for some disciplines. The disciplines are broadly categorized into four groups,
- Life Sciences
- Natural Sciences
- Humanities and Social Scienced
- Engineering Sciences

The goal is that, over time, the different disciplines would have very specific guidelines on how to complete a Data Management Plan. This would in turn improve tha value associated with those DMPs and contribute towards better RDM.

## Who is this book for? 

Researchers, Data Stewards, Research Software Engineers, Data Managers etc. 

- Improve the relevance of DMPs for researchers across different disciplines. 
- Utilizing a standard template, minimizes fragmentation, while tailored guidelines still provide aprropriate context specific responses. 
- Identify similarities and differences in research data management practice across diverse research disciplines 


## How can you use this book? 

Use the relevant guidelines when creating a Data Management Plan. Add these guidelines to institution specific guidelines to provide comprehensive support to researchers. 
Contribute to this book by adding guidelines for a new discipline or improve the guidelines for an existing one. 
  
## How was this book created? 
  
This book was created by the members of the Discipline Specific Guidance for DMPs WG from the RDA. A survey was conduceted among researchers at all levels along with members of reserach support to obtain a broad idea about the landscape of RDM among researchers. The initial guidelines were created by the members of the working groupt based on the input from community memebers from different research groups.
  
## How to contribute!
  
The goal is to have the community in academia and industry to actively contribute to the guidelines to that the it stays relevant and provides the most pertinent help to those creating their DMPs. Please refer to the README file in the github repo on how to contribute to this resource. If you are not familiar with using git, the links on the readme will allow you to contribute by filling in the template, so that members of the community can upadte the book.
