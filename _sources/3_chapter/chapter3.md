# Guidance for DMPs in Marine Science

## GENERAL INFORMATION


## DATA DESCRIPTION AND COLLECTION OR RE-USE OF EXISTING DATA

### How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used?
- Marine science: Observation platforms such as ARGO floats and Unmanned vehicles with dedicated captors, CTD bottles output. Data collected through scientific cruise campaigns

### What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes), will be collected or produced?
Marine science: Environmental data 
Sea temperature (formats: csv, netcdf)
Contaminants in water  (formats: csv)
Turbidity

DOCUMENTATION AND DATA QUALITY

What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organising data) will accompany the data?
Marine science: Metadata with description of parameters using the BODC/Seadatanet vocabularies (https://vocab.seadatanet.org/search), lat. long., …. Metadata respecting INSPIRE directives, mostly in xml format. Metadata can be formatted through the use of “MIKADO javatool” (https://www.seadatanet.org/Software/MIKADO )
What data quality control measures will be used?

• 

STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE RESEARCH PROCESS
How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research?
• Marine science : Data and metadata will be stored at the NODC (National Oceaongraphy Data Center) hosted at Ifremer (or an NODC from another country) which got the COreTrustSeal certification
• 
• 
• 

How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research?
•
•
•
•
•

LEGAL AND ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS, CODES OF CONDUCT

If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured?
•
•
•
•
•

How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?
•  Marine Science: When a dataset is published either on CDI-SDN (https://cdi.seadatanet.org/search) or on SEANOE (https://www.seanoe.org/html/about.htm) there is most of the time a licence such as the Creative COmmons licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=en)
• 
•
•

What ethical issues and codes of conduct are there, and how will they be taken into account?
•  Marine science : Main issue could be with biological data in other countries EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zones). They should then be in agreement with the Nagoya protocol/agreement
• 
•
•


DATA SHARING AND LONG-TERM PRESERVATION

How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo
reasons?

• Marine science : Data and metadata should be available in one of the repositories which has a CoreTrustSeal certificate. However there can be some restrictions depending on the type of data (economic data) and time period (embargo on geological data for example which can be between 3 to 5 years)
• 
•
•

How will data for preservation be selected, and where data will be preserved long-term (for
example a data repository or archive)?
• 
• 
• 
• 

What methods or software tools are needed to access and use data?
• 
•
•
• 

How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier
(DOI)) to each data set be ensured?
• 
•
•
• 

DATA MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND RESOURCES

Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)?
• 
• 
• 
• 

What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?
